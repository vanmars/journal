// Create a journaling website where a user can write entries including at least a title and body. 

// Create Entry objects that include a method to return the number of words in the entry. 

// Then, add a separate method (or methods) to return the number of vowels and consonants in each entry. 

// Finally, add a method called getTeaser to return the first sentence of the entry. If the sentence is over 8 words, only display those first 8 words.
